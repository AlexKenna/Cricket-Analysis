    "\n",
    "All missing data in the summary dataset is systematic and expected. Particularly, players were only excluded for two reasons related to the number of games they had played:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The player had batted in fewer than 10 One-Day International matches.\n",
    "2. The player had batted in fewer than 10 Domestic matches.\n",
    "\n",
    "Resultantly, it is possible for players to be recorded in the summary dataset without having played all domestic formats. In these cases, the players summary for the format(s) they had not participated in were intentionally left blank (NaN).\n",
    "\n",
    "While blank fields make intuitive sense where data has not been recorded, very few models can reasonably deal with missing data. Here, we will attempt to determine the best method for managing missing data in our model.\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "With each missing data management method tested, we can rank their success as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Remove columns containing missing data.\n",
    "2. Fill missing data with the columns median.\n",
    "3. Fill missing data with the columns mean.\n",
    "4. Remove rows containing missing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "From this ranking, we can choose the method to use for the remainder of the project. Particularly, it was chosen that missing data would be filled with the column median. Initially, this may seem counterintuitive as removing the columns with missing data was a more successful approach. However, it is believed that the reason for the success of removing the missing data columns is more the result of feature selection - removing features that are detrimental to the performance of the model. As feature selection is explored later in this project, we will assess this belief then."
